# Forecasting-and-predictive-analytics
It includes the R script of Forecasting and Predictive project, which is divided into 2 part. The first one is Alcohol Project, where I apply the logistic regression to predict the Legit and Fraud wine.
In the second part, Hy/vee Sale project, I build a model that can predict the future sale of the alcoholic beverage of Hy/vee stores.
